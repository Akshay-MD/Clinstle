        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Let us manage complexity with you. Our integrated drug development platform is built to handle multisite hybrid study designs, rapid-sequence dose escalations, sophisticated biomarker or imaging exploratory endpoints, extemporaneous investigational product preparation and more. And as we manage the conduct of your complex study, we never take our eyes off the two critical focal points— scientific integrity and human subject safety.</p>
        <p>Clinical pharmacology is the link between the preclinical data and the targeted population. Our team of scientists and clinicians put principles into action by closely monitoring testing, including preliminary evaluation of drug safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics. As more information on your molecule becomes available, we’ll scrutinize development progress and deliver unique insights for decisions.

        As your drug moves toward registration, expertise across complex, specialty and standard studies can mean the difference between one partner and managing multiple vendors. You’ll have access to more than 316 beds at four sites across the U.S. and U.K. As one of the largest early-stage clinical research organizations in the world, we offer a comprehensive suite of pharmacology services to manage every step of your early clinical development.</p>
